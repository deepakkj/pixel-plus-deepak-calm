                question: "What is meditation?",
                answer: `<p>Meditation is the practice of allowing thoughts to come and go, as you learn to recognize and release them
  without judgment. Studies show that a long-term meditation practice can actually help shift your nervous
  system out of fight or flight and into the relaxed parasympathetic mode producing a wide array of benefits*
  including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Decreased anxiety and depression symptoms</li>
    <li>Chronic pain management</li>
    <li>Lower stress levels</li>
    <li>Improved sleep quality</li>

                question: "What is mindfulness?",
                answer: `<p>Mindfulness is a practice that involves intentionally bringing one's attention and awareness to the present
  moment without judgment. It's about being fully present and engaged in the here and now, rather than
  dwelling on the past or worrying about the future. Mindfulness encourages a non-judgmental attitude towards
  one's thoughts, emotions and sensations, allowing them to arise and pass without any added stress. By
  cultivating mindfulness, people often develop a greater sense of clarity, calmness and overall wellbeing, as
  well as enhance their ability to respond skillfully to the challenges of life.</p>`

                question: "What causes stress and anxiety?",
                answer: `<p>Stress and anxiety can have various causes and can differ greatly from person to person. Here are a few common factors that contribute to stress and anxiety:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Major life changes: Significant life events such as moving, getting married (or divorced), starting a new job or experiencing the loss of a loved one can trigger it.</li>
    <li>Work or school pressure: High workloads, tight deadlines, challenging bosses, or work pressure can lead to stress and anxiety.</li>
    <li>Financial challenges: Job loss, debt, or just struggling to make ends meet can be a significant source of stress and anxiety.</li>
    <li>Relationships: Whether romantic, familial or social, strain or conflict in relationships can cause stress and anxiety.</li>
    <li>Health concerns: Managing chronic illness, physical pain or battling a health condition can be a cause, as well.</li>
    <li>Traumatic experiences: Experiencing a traumatic event, such as an accident, abuse or even a natural disaster can lead to anxiety-related conditions.</li>
    <li>Uncertainty and change: Experiencing frequent change (even positive change!) or feeling uncertain about the future can be a common cause of anxiety.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>It's important to note that not everyone experiences stress and anxiety in the same way. If you're dealing with stress and anxiety, it's recommended to seek support from a mental health professional who can provide personalized guidance.</p>`

                question: "How can I manage my stress and anxiety?",
                answer: `<p>Once you're in the Calm app, we recommend using a Breathing Bubble exercise if you're looking for immediate stress or anxiety relief. Breathwork elicits the body's relaxation response which reduces tension and lowers stress.</p>
