## About
This **Next.js** project recreates Calm’s homepage with pixel-perfect fidelity.  
No backend or external APIs—just a fully server-rendered, interactive front end.  

---

## Features
Beyond the original design, I’ve added **three** bonus features to showcase interactivity, animations, and state persistence:

### 1. Guided Breathing
**“Take a Deep Breath Now”**  
A pulsing gradient circle guides you through inhale, hold, and exhale cycles—perfect for a quick pause in your day.

### 2. Ambient Sound Mixer
**“Start Mixing Your Calm Now”**  
Blend rain, ocean waves, and white noise to create a personalized soundscape for focus, relaxation, or sleep.

### 3. Mood Tracker
**“How do you feel?”**  
Open the modal, pick an emoji, jot a 140-char note, and review your last five entries in a smooth carousel—data lives in `localStorage`.
